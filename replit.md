# Overview

This is **D-Invoice**, a production-ready Point of Sale (POS) system built specifically for Pakistani businesses with comprehensive FBR (Federal Board of Revenue) compliance. The application is designed as a **desktop-distributed solution** using a full-stack TypeScript architecture with React frontend and Express backend, supporting English-only operations, authentic tax calculations according to Pakistani regulations, and real-world invoice generation with actual FBR IRIS system integration.

The system is designed for **standalone desktop installations** distributed to individual businesses, eliminating hosting costs and providing complete local control. It handles core retail operations including inventory management, sales processing, customer management, universal hardware integration (card readers, barcode scanners), and comprehensive reporting while ensuring full compliance with Pakistani tax regulations and FBR requirements.

**Distribution Model**: Commercial desktop application sold to multiple Pakistani businesses with independent installations per business. Each installation is completely isolated with its own database, settings, and user accounts, supporting offline operations with optional cloud sync capabilities. Perfect for retail stores, restaurants, pharmacies, and any business requiring FBR-compliant invoicing.

**Commercial Sales Strategy**: Multi-channel distribution including direct B2B sales (PKR 50,000-200,000), reseller partnerships, online marketplace presence, hardware bundle deals, and franchise models. Target markets include retail, hospitality, healthcare, and service businesses requiring FBR compliance.

**Production Status**: ALL demo/simulation features have been completely eliminated. The system enforces strict validation that blocks any digital invoicing operations without valid PRAL API credentials. Integration follows the correct Pakistani architecture: POS → PRAL APIs → FBR system. Zero tolerance for demo/test functionality.

**Recent Updates (Aug 2025)**:

  - Card reader integration (EMV, contactless, chip & swipe)
- ✅ Application running stable on port 5000 with PostgreSQL backend
- ✅ FBR compliance features active and ready for business deployment
- ✅ Clean, production-ready codebase with comprehensive error handling

**Email System**: Complete plug-and-play email configuration through application interface. Business owners can configure SMTP settings directly in the Settings → Email tab without any technical file editing. Supports Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and custom domain email providers with professional invoice delivery and payment reminders.

**NTN Verification System**: Complete real-time NTN verification infrastructure ready for PRAL API integration. System validates format locally and provides seamless API integration points for authentic FBR verification when PRAL credentials are provided.

**Target Users**: Pakistani business owners who need FBR-compliant POS systems with local hardware integration and offline capabilities.

**Security Enforcement**: System validates all FBR credentials, rejects demo/test tokens, and only accepts official government API endpoints. Production-ready for real business use with actual IRIS integration.
